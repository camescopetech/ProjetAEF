This project is a school assignment designed by BEZET Camille, SALAVILLE Erwan, FORTIER ThÃ©o, EL MABROUK Imen et GARCIA-MEGEVAND Thibault. We are the group2 in the python project.

You will find a graphical interface allowing the manipulation of automaton by subjecting them to various processing and testing

Many files can be found in the git, each file answers one or more question. 
.txt files are here to explain some functions or be used as a test automaton (such as the test.txt)
